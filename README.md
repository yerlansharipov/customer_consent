# The Correlation of Twitter Sentiment with Stock Valuation
Can Twitter Help Investors Predict the Value of a Company’s Stock?

With Twitter users generating ample data during a day on multiple topics, the team  mines such data, with mentions of a specific company. The sentiment of these tweets is then correlated to the closing value of a stock by day. 
Shareholders and company executives may then be able to predict if dissatisfaction affects the value of their company and holdings

## Lessons Learned
- Open-source API’s are tricky because there is no direct assistance from the API’s owners
- API’s are discontinued from time to time, e.g. the Yahoo Finance stock market API; and often, the data is limited, e.g. the Quandl stock market API provides data up to March 26, 2018
- There is a lot of potential with the Twitter API, aside from a sentiment analysis: the team can imagine extensive models which return most used words, heatmaps on where a product is used the most, etc. allowing entities such as small businesses or indie artists to thrive in the digital economy
